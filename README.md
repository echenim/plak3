Description of Each Directory
cmd/app/main.go: This is the entry point of your application. It should initialize and start your web server, and tie together different parts of your application.

internal/handlers: This directory will contain your HTTP handlers. Each handler will process HTTP requests and prepare HTTP responses.

internal/models: Here, you define data structures that represent your business model. For example, a User struct for a user management system.

internal/repositories: Repositories are used for database interactions. You'll implement functions here to create, read, update, and delete records from your database.

internal/routes: This directory will contain route definitions. Here, you'll map URLs to their corresponding handlers.

internal/services: The services layer contains business logic. It acts as an intermediary between your handlers and repositories.

go.mod: This file manages your project's dependencies.

Build: This directory can contain scripts or configuration files needed for building your application.

Tests: Here, you'll write tests for your application. Organize them to mirror the structure of your internal directory for clarity.

write web application in golang using fasthttp


Initialization: Ensure each package is correctly initialized, especially the repository with the database connection.
Dependency Injection: Pass dependencies (like repositories to services) through function parameters or struct fields.
Error Handling: Implement robust error handling throughout the application.
Configuration: Set up configuration for database credentials, server port, etc., potentially using environment variables or a configuration file.


Implementing authentication and authorization


write a web application using fasthttp with authentication





implement a user management system with fasthttp
--
Ensure each package is correctly initialized, especially the repository with the database connection.

ensure that the database connection string (dataSourceName) should ideally come from a configuration file

implement dependency injection in the  application using uber-go/dig

now Set up configuration for database credentials, server port, etc., using a configuration file

Update your repositories and server start-up to use the provided configuration

add authentication and authorization





write a golang web user management application from scratch using fasthttp

structure the crud application into
cmd/app/main.go
handlers
models
repositories
services
routes


Ensure each package is correctly initialized, especially the repository, services,handler, router and also include setup repository with the database connection

use uber-go/dig as the dependency injection library



curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"name":"John", "email":"<john@example.com>"}' \
    "<http://localhost:8080/searchUser>"






Consider token expiration and renewal strategies

You can expand upon this by adding more sophisticated user management, role-based access control, and other security features as needed
